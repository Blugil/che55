# Welcome to che55.online, an ultralight version of chess.com and a light version of lichess.org

## Philosophy

We wanted to create a chess platform that was as minimal as possible. No accounts needed, no elo system, and no global games. che55.online serves as a way to challenge people to a chess match and nothing more.

## Technology

che55.online uses a few very powerful techologies to drive its complex simplicity and extreme ease of use including:

1. Node.js/Express.js (for the server)
2. Socket.io (Websocket technologies)
3. React (for the frontend) 
4. Docker (for deployment)

These technologies all serve a vital role in keeping this project funcitonal to the level that it is.
