## Our Motivation

We wanted to create a chess platform that was as minimal as possible. No accounts needed, no elo system, and no global games. che55.online serves as a way to challenge people to a chess match and nothing more.

## Technology

che55.online uses a few very powerful techologies to drive its complex simplicity and extreme ease of use including:

* Node.js/Express.js (for the server)
* Socket.io (Websocket technologies)
* React (for the frontend) 
* Docker (for deployment)
